Starting something new

My name is Nemanja, I'm 30 years old. Currently I live in Malta and looking for a way to change my career. I am a Graduate Journalist, but since my graduation I've been working mainly in Food&Beverage Industry and I feel the time is right to learn something new and make a exciting twist in my life.
